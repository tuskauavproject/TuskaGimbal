Tuska Project Camera Gimbal System
=========
----
This is a repository for The Tuska UAV Project camera gimbal system.The goal of this project is to create a standalone auto-leveling gimbal system using a control feedback loop that can be mounted on our UAV. This will be done using an arduino, an IMU (inertial measurement unit), along with motors to orient the camera.
